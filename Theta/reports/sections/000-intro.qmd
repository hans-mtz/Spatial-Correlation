# The Data Generating Process

The DGP process used in these simulations is as follows. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    y_l, x_l &\sim (1-\rho)\epsilon_l +\rho \eta_l \\
    \epsilon_l &\sim N(0,1) \\
    \eta_l &\sim \mathcal{G}(\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$ 

$(y_l,x_l,\epsilon_l,\eta_l)$ are associated with observed spatial location $s_l \in \mathbb{R}^2$. $\epsilon$ is a white noise independent of $s_l$. $\eta$ is generated by a Gaussian process with covariance function $cov(s_l,s_{l'})=\exp(-\theta^{-1}||s_l-s_{l'}||)$. The parameter $\rho\in[0,1)$ controls the spatial correlation of observations.



# Simulations

In the simulations, the regression model is

$$
    y_l=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_l + u_l
$$

because $y_l$ and $x_l$ are independent draws from the same DGP, the true parameters are $\beta=(0,0)'$. Also, $\theta=\sqrt{2}/10$. I used **500** observations $(y_l,x_l,s_l)$. Locations are independently and uniformly drawn from the unit square. The rejection frequencies were estimated from 200 simulations.

# Spatial vs. Time Series correlation {#sec-ar1}

For reference, when $\rho=1$, the average of the elements of the variance-covariance matrix resulting from the covariance function $cov(s_l,s_{l'})=\exp(-\theta^{-1}||s_l-s_{l'}||)$ with $\theta=\sqrt{2}/10$ is 0.0839. This value is approximately equivalent to an AR(1) process with a slope of ~0.96.

The following table shows the average of the elements of the variance-covariance matrix of an AR(1) process with different values of autocorrelation, $\delta$. That is, for a value of $\delta$ and $T$ observations, the var-cov matrix will look like the following:

$$
    V = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & \delta & \delta^2 & \cdots & \delta^{T-1} \\
    \delta & 1 & \delta & \cdots & \delta^{T-2} \\
    \delta^2 & \delta & 1 & \cdots & \delta^{T-3} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \delta^{T-1} & \delta^{T-2} & \delta^{T-3} & \cdots & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
