   abstract = {This paper presents a spatial model of dependence among agents using a metric of economic distance. Measurements of this economic distance provide cross-sectional data with a structure similar to that provided by the time index in time-series data. Generalized method of moments estimators using such dependent data are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. This paper presents a class of non-parametric, positive semi-de"nite covariance matrix estimators that allow for general forms of dependence characterized by economic distance. These covariance matrix estimators are shown to remain consistent when economic distances are not precisely observed. 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an inference approach for dependent data in time series, spatial, and panel data applications. The method involves constructing t and Wald statistics using a cluster covariance matrix estimator (CCE). We use an approximation that takes the number of clusters/groups as fixed and the number of observations per group to be large. The resulting limiting distributions of the t and Wald statistics are standard t and F distributions where the number of groups plays the role of sample size. Using a small number of groups is analogous to 'fixed-b' asymptotics of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002, 2005) (KV) for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent inference. We provide simulation evidence that demonstrates that the procedure substantially outperforms conventional inference procedures. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Conley2018,
   abstract = {We review developments in conducting inference for model parameters in the presence of intertemporal and cross-sectional dependence with an emphasis on panel data applications. We review the use of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard error estimators, which include the standard clustered and multiway clustered estimators, and discuss alternative sample-splitting inference procedures, such as the Fama–Macbeth procedure, within this context. We outline pros and cons of the different procedures. We then illustrate the properties of the discussed procedures within a simulation experiment designed to mimic the type of firm-level panel data that might be encountered in accounting and finance applications. Our conclusion, based on theoretical properties and simulation performance, is that sample-splitting procedures with suitably chosen splits are the most likely to deliver robust inferential statements with approximately correct coverage properties in the types of large, heterogeneous panels many researchers are likely to face.},

   abstract = {We consider inference about a scalar coefficient in a linear regression with spatially correlated errors. Recent suggestions for more robust inference require stationarity of both regressors and dependent variables for their large sample validity. This rules out many empirically relevant applications, such as difference-indifference designs. We develop a robustified version of the recently suggested SCPC method that addresses this challenge. We find that the method has good size properties in a wide range of Monte Carlo designs that are calibrated to real world applications, both in a pure cross sectional setting, but also for spatially correlated panel data. We provide numerically efficient methods for computing the associated spatial-correlation robust test statistics, critical values, and confidence intervals. ARTICLE HISTORY},

@article{Muller2022ECTA,
   abstract = {We propose a method for constructing confidence intervals that account for many forms of spatial correlation. The interval has the familiar "estimator plus and minus a standard error times a critical value" form, but we propose new methods for constructing the standard error and the critical value. The standard error is constructed using population principal components from a given "worst-case" spatial correlation model. The critical value is chosen to ensure coverage in a benchmark parametric model for the spatial correlations. The method is shown to control coverage in finite sample Gaussian settings in a restricted but nonparametric class of models and in large samples whenever the spatial correlation is weak, that is, with average pairwise correlations that vanish as the sample size gets large. We also provide results on the efficiency of the method.},
