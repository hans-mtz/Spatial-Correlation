Under minimal moment assumptions, we show that the smallest singular value is of order nâ1/2, which is optimal for Gaussian matrices. Moreover, we give a optimal estimate on the tail probability. This comes as a consequence of a new and essentially sharp estimate in the LittlewoodâOfford problem: for i.i.d. random variables Xk and real numbers ak, determine the probability p that the sum âkakXk lies near some number v. For arbitrary coefficients ak of the same order of magnitude, we show that they essentially lie in an arithmetic progression of length 1/p."

The method involves constructing t and Wald statistics using a cluster covariance matrix estimator (CCE). We use an approximation that takes the number of clusters/groups as fixed and the number of observations per group to be large. The resulting limiting distributions of the t and Wald statistics are standard t and F distributions where the number of groups plays the role of sample size. Using a small number of groups is analogous to âfixed-bâ asymptotics of Kiefer and Vogelsang, 2002, Kiefer and Vogelsang, 2005 (KV) for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent inference. We provide simulation evidence that demonstrates that the procedure substantially outperforms conventional inference procedures."

    abstract = { This paper presents a spatial econometric method for characterizing productivity comovement across sectors of the U.S. economy. Input‐output relations provide an economic distance measure that is used to characterize interactions between sectors, as well as conduct estimation and inference. We construct two different economic distance measures. One metric implies that two sectors are close to one another if they use inputs of other industrial sectors in nearly the same proportion, and the other metric implies that sectors are close if their outputs are used by the same sectors. Our model holds that covariance in productivity growth across sectors is a function of economic distance. We find that (1) positive cross‐sector covariance of productivity growth generates a substantial fraction of the variance in aggregate productivity, (2) cross‐sector productivity covariance tends to be greatest between sectors with similar input relations, and (3) there are constant to modest increasing returns to scale. We test and reject the hypothesis that these correlations are due to a common shock. }

abstract = {Abstract This paper examines the spatial patterns of unemployment in Chicago between 1980 and 1990. We study unemployment clustering with respect to different social and economic distance metrics that reflect the structure of agents' social networks. Specifically, we use physical distance, travel time, and differences in ethnic and occupational distribution between locations. Our goal is to determine whether our estimates of spatial dependence are consistent with models in which agents' employment status is affected by information exchanged locally within their social networks. We present non-parametric estimates of correlation across Census tracts as a function of each distance metric as well as pairs of metrics, both for unemployment rate itself and after conditioning on a set of tract characteristics. Our results indicate that there is a strong positive and statistically significant degree of spatial dependence in the distribution of raw unemployment rates, for all our metrics. However, once we condition on a set of covariates, most of the spatial autocorrelation is eliminated, with the exception of physical and occupational distance. Racial and ethnic composition variables are the single most important factor in explaining the observed correlation patterns. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {When does a metric space admit a bilipschitz embedding into some finite-dimensional Euclidean space? There does not seem to be a simple answer to this question. Results of Assouad [A1], [A2], [A3] do provide a simple answer if one permits some small ("snowflake") deformations of the metric, but unfortunately these deformations immediately disrupt some basic aspects of geometry and analysis, like rectinability, differentiability, and curves of finite length. Here we discuss a (somewhat technical) criterion which permits more modest deformations, based on small powers of an A₁ weight. For many purposes this type of deformation is quite innocuous, as in standard results in harmonic analysis about Ap weights [J], [Ga], [St2]. In particular, it cooperates well with "uniform rectifiability" [DS2], [DS4].},

abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for a linear functional of a regression function, such as its value at a point, the regression discontinuity parameter, or a regression coefficient in a linear or partly linear regression. Our main assumption is that the regression function is known to lie in a convex function class, which covers most smoothness and/or shape assumptions used in econometrics. We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic results when the error distribution is not known. When the function class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs are close to efficient at smooth regression functions. This implies, in particular, that it is impossible to form CIs that are substantively tighter using data-dependent tuning parameters, and maintain coverage over the whole function class. We specialize our results to inference on the regression discontinuity parameter, and illustrate them in simulations and an empirical application.}

 abstract = {Improving college performance and retention can be difficult. We propose a simple and low-cost change in the way colleges use the ACT exam in their admission decisions that can greatly increase their ability to identify students at a high risk of underperforming and dropping out. Specifically, we show that only two of the four subtests of the ACT, English and Mathematics, can effectively predict outcomes in college. This result is robust across various samples, specifications and outcome measures. We demonstrate that by eliminating the noise associated with the two nonpredictive subtests, student-college matches can be significantly improved.},

abstract = "In econometric applications it is common that the exact form of a conditional expectation is unknown and having flexible functional forms can lead to improvements over a pre-specified functional form, especially if they nest some successful parametric economically-motivated forms. Series method offers exactly that by approximating the unknown function based on k basis functions, where k is allowed to grow with the sample size n to balance the trade off between variance and bias. In this work we consider series estimators for the conditional mean in light of four new ingredients: (i) sharp LLNs for matrices derived from the non-commutative Khinchin inequalities, (ii) bounds on the Lebesgue factor that controls the ratio between the L∞ and L2-norms of approximation errors, (iii) maximal inequalities for processes whose entropy integrals diverge at some rate, and (iv) strong approximations to series-type processes. These technical tools allow us to contribute to the series literature, specifically the seminal work of Newey (1997), as follows. First, we weaken considerably the condition on the number k of approximating functions used in series estimation from the typical k2/n→0 to k/n→0, up to log factors, which was available only for spline series before. Second, under the same weak conditions we derive L2 rates and pointwise central limit theorems results when the approximation error vanishes. Under an incorrectly specified model, i.e. when the approximation error does not vanish, analogous results are also shown. Third, under stronger conditions we derive uniform rates and functional central limit theorems that hold if the approximation error vanishes or not. That is, we derive the strong approximation for the entire estimate of the nonparametric function. Finally and most importantly, from a point of view of practice, we derive uniform rates, Gaussian approximations, and uniform confidence bands for a wide collection of linear functionals of the conditional expectation function, for example, the function itself, the partial derivative function, the conditional average partial derivative function, and other similar quantities. All of these results are new."

Our analysis provides a set of high-level conditions under which inference for the low-dimensional parameter based on testing or point estimation methods will be regular despite selection or regularization biases occurring in the estimation of the high-dimensional nuisance parameter. A key element is the use of so-called immunized or orthogonal estimating equations that are locally insensitive to small mistakes in the estimation of the high-dimensional nuisance parameter. As an illustration, we analyze affine-quadratic models and specialize these results to a linear instrumental variables model with many regressors and many instruments. We conclude with a review of other developments in post-selection inference and note that many can be viewed as special cases of the general encompassing framework of orthogonal estimating equations provided in this article. }

 abstract = {For 116 countries from 1965 to 1985, the lowest quintile had an average growth rate of real per capita GDP of -1.3%, whereas the highest quintile had an average of 4.8%. We isolate five influences that discriminate reasonably well between the slow and fast-growers: a conditional convergence effect, whereby a country grows faster if it begins with lower real per capita GDP relative to its initial level of human capital in the fOnTIS of educational attainment and health; a positive effect on growth from a high ratio of investment to GDP (although this effect is weaker than that reported in some previous studies); a negative effect from overly large government; a negative effect from government-induced distortions of markets; and a negative effect from political instability. Overall, the fitted growth rates for 85 countries for 1965-85 had a correlation of 0.8 with the actual values. We also find that female educational attainment has a pronounced negative effect on fertility, whereas female and male attainment are each positively related to life expectancy and negatively related to infant mortality. Male attainment plays a positive role in primary-school enrollment ratios, and male and female attainment relate positively to enrollment at the secondary and higher levels.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a kernel-based estimation principle for nonparametric models named local partitioned regression (LPR). This principle is a nonparametric generalization of the familiar partition regression in linear models. It has several key advantages: First, it generates estimators for a very large class of semi- and nonparametric models. A number of examples that are particularly relevant for economic applications will be discussed in this paper. This class contains the additive, partially linear, and varying coefficient models as well as several other models that have not been discussed in the literature. Second, LPR-based estimators achieve optimality criteria: They have optimal speed of convergence and are oracle-efficient. Moreover, they are simple in structure, widely applicable, and computationally inexpensive. A Monte Carlo simulation highlights these advantages.},

 abstract = {In econometrics, seminonparametric (SNP) estimators originated in the consumer demand literature. The Fourier flexible form is a well-known example. The idea is to replace the consumer's indirect utility function with a truncated series expansion and then use a parametric procedure, such as nonlinear multivariate regression, to set a confidence interval on an elasticity. More recently, SNP estimators have been used in nonlinear time series analysis. A truncated Hermite expansion with an ARCH leading term is used as the conditional density of the process. The method of maximum likelihood is used to fit it to data. One problem, though, is selecting the truncation point so that a confidence interval set on an evaluation functional such as an elasticity is accurate. We examine this problem in a simple situation: a univariate Fourier series expansion over its natural domain [0,2π) fitted by least squares to equally spaced data. The true data-generating process is assumed to have a periodic, smooth response function and additive i.i.d. errors. We first consider deterministic truncation procedures. The asymptotic normality and consistency of estimates of evaluation functionals are established. We find the rate of growth in the truncation point that minimizes a sharp upper bound on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance from the standard normal distribution. We examine the coverage of confidence intervals in a two-factor Monte Carlo experiment. The two factors are the variance of the errors and the roughness of the response function of the data-generating process. Both theory and the Monte Carlo experiment suggest that deterministic truncation procedures have undesirable properties and do not give accurate confidence intervals. We next consider adaptive procedures. We establish the asymptotic normality and consistency for a class of adaptive procedures which includes an upwards F-testing procedure. We re-examine confidence interval coverage by repeating the Monte Carlo experiment. It is much improved, and the undesirable properties of deterministic procedures are overcome. The results give much encouragement to use of SNP procedures in more complex estimation problems.},

Polynomial series estimators, trigonometric series estimators, and Gallant's Fourier flexible form estimators are prime examples of the estimators covered by the results. The results apply to a wide variety of estimands in the regression model under consideration, including derivatives and integrals of the regression function. The errors in the model may be homoskedastic or heteroskedastic. The paper also considers series estimators for additive interactive regression (AIR), partially linear regression, and semiparametric index regression models and shows them to be consistent and asymptotically normal.

  abstract = 	 {Can we learn a sparse graph from observing the value of a few random cuts? This and more general problems can be reduced to the challenge of learning set functions known to have sparse Fourier support contained in some collection. We prove that if we choose O(k log^4 n) sets uniformly at random, then with high probability, observing any k-sparse function on those sets is sufficient to recover that function exactly. We further show that other properties, such as symmetry or submodularity imply structure in the Fourier spectrum, which can be exploited to further reduce sample complexity. One interesting special case  is that it suffices to observe O(|E| log^4 |V|) values of a cut function to recover a graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results on two real-world reconstruction problems:  graph sketching and obtaining fast approximate surrogates to expensive submodular objective functions.}

Under selection on observables, we construct confidence intervals using a doubly-robust estimator that are robust to model selection errors and prove their uniform validity over a large class of models that allows for multivalued treatments with heterogeneous effects and selection amongst (possibly) more covariates than observations. The semiparametric efficiency bound is attained under appropriate conditions. Precise conditions are given for any model selector to yield these results, and we specifically propose the group lasso, which is apt for treatment effects, and derive new results for high-dimensional, sparse multinomial logistic regression. Both a simulation study and revisiting the National Supported Work demonstration show our estimator performs well in finite samples. "

abstract ={In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without “sparsity” assumptions. We propose an “honest” approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74% and 84% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7–22%.},

Our analysis provides a set of high-level conditions under which inference for the low-dimensional parameter based on testing or point estimation methods will be regular despite selection or regularization biases occurring in the estimation of the high-dimensional nuisance parameter. A key element is the use of so-called immunized or orthogonal estimating equations that are locally insensitive to small mistakes in the estimation of the high-dimensional nuisance parameter. As an illustration, we analyze affine-quadratic models and specialize these results to a linear instrumental variables model with many regressors and many instruments. We conclude with a review of other developments in post-selection inference and note that many can be viewed as special cases of the general encompassing framework of orthogonal estimating equations provided in this article. }

abstract="In this paper we study a family of gradient descent algorithms to approximate the regression function from reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), the family being characterized by a polynomial decreasing rate of step sizes (or learning rate). By solving a bias-variance trade-off we obtain an early stopping rule and someprobabilistic upper bounds for the convergence of the algorithms. We also discuss the implication of these results in the context of classification where some fast convergence rates can be achieved for plug-in classifiers. Some connections are addressed with Boosting, Landweber iterations, and the online learning algorithms as stochastic approximations of the gradient descent method.",

Coarse thinking exhibits two features that persuaders take advantage of: (i) transference, whereby individuals transfer the informational content of a given message from situations in a category where it is useful to those where it is not, and (ii) framing, whereby objectively useless information influences individuals' choice of category. The model sheds light on uninformative advertising and product branding, as well as on some otherwise anomalous evidence on mutual fund advertising.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, spatial-interaction models have been increasingly used in economics. However, the development of a sufficiently general asymptotic theory for nonlinear spatial models has been hampered by a lack of relevant central limit theorems (CLTs), uniform laws of large numbers (ULLNs) and pointwise laws of large numbers (LLNs). These limit theorems form the essential building blocks towards developing the asymptotic theory of M-estimators, including maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments estimators. The paper establishes a CLT, ULLN, and LLN for spatial processes or random fields that should be applicable to a broad range of data processes.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is the presentation of a general formula for the asymptotic variance of a semiparametric estimator. A particularly important feature of this formula is a way of accounting for the presence of nonparametric estimates of nuisance functions. The general form of an adjustment factor for nonparametric estimates is derived and analyzed. The usefulness of the formula is illustrated by deriving propositions on invariance of the limiting distribution with respect to the nonparametric estimator, conditions for nonparametric estimation to have no effect on the asymptotic distribution, and the form of a correction term for the presence of nonparametric projection and density estimators. Examples discussed are quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of index models, panel probit with semiparametric individual effects, average derivatives, and inverse density weighted least squares. The paper also develops a set of regularity conditions for the validity of the asymptotic variance formula. Primitive regularity conditions are derived for <tex-math>$\sqrt{n}\text{-consistency}$</tex-math> and asymptotic normality for functions of series estimators of projections. Specific examples are polynomial estimators of average derivative and semiparametric panel probit models.},

 abstract = {We consider the model y = Xθ* + ξ, Z = X + Ξ, where the random vector y ∈ ℝ n and the random n × p matrix Z are observed, the n × p matrix X is unknown, Ξ is an n × p random noise matrix, ξ ∈ ℝ n is a noise independent of Ξ, and θ* is a vector of unknown parameters to be estimated. The matrix uncertainty is in the fact that X is observed with additive error. For dimensions p that can be much larger than the sample size n, we consider the estimation of sparse vectors θ*. Under matrix uncertainty, the Lasso and Dantzig selector turn out to be extremely unstable in recovering the sparsity pattern (i.e., of the set of nonzero components of θ*), even if the noise level is very small. We suggest new estimators called matrix uncertainty selectors (or, shortly, the MU-selectors) which are close to θ* in different norms and in the prediction risk if the restricted eigenvalue assumption on X is satisfied. We also show that under somewhat stronger assumptions, these estimators recover correctly the sparsity pattern.},

abstract = {We develop a general approach to robust inference about a scalar parameter of interest when the data is potentially heterogeneous and correlated in a largely unknown way. The key ingredient is the following result of Bakirov and Sz{\'{e}}kely (2005) concerning the small sample properties of the standard t-test: For a significance level of 5{\%} or lower, the t-test remains conservative for underlying observations that are independent and Gaussian with heterogenous variances. One might thus conduct robust large sample inference as follows: partition the data into q≥2 groups, estimate the model for each group, and conduct a standard t-test with the resulting q parameter estimators of interest. This results in valid and in some sense efficient inference when the groups are chosen in a way that ensures the parameter estimators to be asymptotically independent, unbiased and Gaussian of possibly different variances. We provide examples of how to apply this approach to time series, panel, clustered and spatially correlat...},

@article{Barrios2012,
abstract = {It is standard practice in regression analyses to allow for clustering in the error covariance matrix if the explanatory variable of interest varies at a more aggregate level (e.g., the state level) than the units of observation (e.g., individuals). Often, however, the structure of the error covariance matrix is more complex, with correlations not vanishing for units in different clusters. Here we explore the implications of such correlations for the actual and estimated precision of least squares estimators. Our main theoretical result is that with equal-sized clusters, if the covariate of interest is randomly assigned at the cluster level, only accounting for non-zero covariances at the cluster level, and ignoring correlations between clusters as well as differences in within-cluster correlations, leads to valid confidence intervals. However, in the absence of random assignment of the covariates, ignoring general correlation structures may lead to biases in standard errors. We illustrate our findings using the 5{\%} public use census data. Based on these results we recommend that researchers as a matter of routine explore the extent of spatial correlations in explanatory variables beyond state level clustering.},

@article{Foerster2011,
abstract = {This paper uses factor analytic methods to decompose industrial production (IP) into components arising from aggregate shocks and idiosyncratic sector-specific shocks. An approximate factor model finds that nearly all (90{\%}) of the variability of quarterly growth rates in IP are associated with common factors. Because common factors may reflect sectoral shocks that have propagated by way of input-output linkages, we then use a multisector growth model to adjust for the effects of these linkages. In particular, we show that neoclassical multisector models, of the type first introduced by Long and Plosser (1983), produce an approximate factor model as a reduced form. A structural factor analysis then indicates that aggregate shocks continue to be the dominant source of variation in IP, but the importance of sectoral shocks more than doubles after the Great Moderation (to 30{\%}). The increase in the relative importance of these shocks follows from a fall in the contribution of aggregate shocks to IP movements after 1984.},

abstract = {We study the importance of production networks for the transmission of macroeconomic shocks using the stock market reaction to monetary policy shocks as a laboratory. We decompose the overall effect of monetary policy shocks into a direct effect and a network effect and attribute 50 to 85 percent of the overall effect to the network effect. Large network effects are a robust feature of the data, and we document similar patterns in realized cash-flow fundamentals. A simple model with intermediate inputs predicts that the reaction of stock returns to shocks follows a spatial autoregression, which we exploit for our empirical strategy. Our results suggest that production networks are an important mechanism for transmitting aggregate shocks to the real economy.},

@article{Cai2021,
abstract = {Clustered standard errors and approximate randomization tests are popular
inference methods that allow for dependence within observations. However, they
require researchers to know the cluster structure ex ante. We propose a
procedure to help researchers discover clusters in panel data. Our method is
based on thresholding an estimated long-run variance-covariance matrix and
requires the panel to be large in the time dimension, but imposes no lower
bound on the number of units. We show that our procedure recovers the true
clusters with high probability with no assumptions on the cluster structure.
The estimated clusters are independently of interest, but they can also be used
in the approximate randomization tests or with conventional cluster-robust
covariance estimators. The resulting procedures control size and have good
power.},
