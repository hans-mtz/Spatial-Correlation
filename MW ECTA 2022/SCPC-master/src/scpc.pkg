d 'scpc': Spatial Correlation Robust Inference.
d
d This Stata package implements the Spatial Correlation Principle Components (SCPC)
d method described in Müller and Watson (2021)
d (http://www.princeton.edu/~umueller/SHAR.pdf) for the construction of confidence 
d intervals that account for many forms of spatial correlation.
d It is implemented as a postestimation command that can be used after the 
d STATA commands "regress", "ivregress", "areg" , "logit" or "probit" as long 
d as these are used with the standard error option "robust" or "cluster". If 
d "cluster" is chosen, then the method assumes that all observations in a cluster
d are at the same spatial location, and corrects for the spatial correlation 
d between clusters.
