## Principal components

@tbl-pc displays the rejection frequencies for the optimal number of the Principal Components of the 64 order 1 and order 2 B-Splines evaluated on the locations of a spatial DGP. The optimal number of PCs was selected using the lowest residuals' BIC from a coarse grid starting at 4 up to 64 (the maximum feasible) in steps of 4 PCs. PCs were sorted before being selected, so the PCs with more information were always picked first. The selection of the number of splines was selec

@tbl-pc-ts shows the rejection frequencies for the time series DGP.
