## Multi-dimensional locations {#sec-multi}

### Spatial DGP

In this set of simulations, the locations are two-dimensional. The locations are independent and follow a uniform distribution.

Tables [-@tbl-vd-grid], [-@tbl-vd-gamma], and [-@tbl-vd-bic] show the rejection frequencies for the different variance estimators using a spatial GDP with uniform distributed two-dimension locations. 

@tbl-vd-grid displays the rejection frequencies holding the number of splines fixed for a grid going from 4 to 12 in steps of 2 splines. 

In @tbl-vd-gamma, the number of splines was selected using the residual's NN correlation closest to 0.05 during simulations. 

Lastly, @tbl-vd-bic shows the rejection frequencies where the optimal number of splines was chosen using the lowest residua's BIC from a grid going from 4 to 12 in steps of 2 splines.
