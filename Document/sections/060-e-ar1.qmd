## B-Splines, and the error term

For a draw of locations $s \sim U(0,1)$ and the DGP described below, I estimate the OLS model with B-Splines varying the order and the quantity. I estimated a simple AR(1) model using the residuals of each estimation.

@tbl-ar1 displays the results. Overall, it looks good; increasing the number of splines reduces the correlation between the error terms. As expected. The true $\beta = (1 , 1.5)$.
