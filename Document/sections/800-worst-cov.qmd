## Worst case covariance function

@Muller2022JBES assume a functional form for the covariance function of the error term that depends on a single parameter. This single parameter has a unique value for a specific average pairwise correlation. The researcher has to provide before the estimation, a maximum average pairwise correlation. Then, because the average pairwise correlation is a decreasing function of the parameter of the covariance function, this parameter induces the largest value of the error variance for the given average pairwise correlation, according to the authors. In the STATA and MATLAB codes, this parameter is set to 0.03 in both, like in their paper. The authors provide instructions on how to adjust the parameter in the help section of the STATA code. In the MATLAB code, a parameter can be adjusted before estimations.
