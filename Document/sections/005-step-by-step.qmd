## Step by step (update)

@fig-hist-sbs displays the distribution of the t-stat, its numerator, and denominator for the 1000 simulations in @sec-kernel. The t-stat and the numerator look normally distributed centered around zero. The distribution of the denominator looks skewed to the right, but so do the HR and SCPC estimators.

I also encountered complex S.E. for a few observations using the Kernel estimator (2-3 out of 1000). It looks like it is more likely to happen when the cutoff distance is the largest 0.050.
