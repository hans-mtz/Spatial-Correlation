## PC

In this exercise, I kept the number of splines fixed at 10 per location dimension and the optimal number of PC was selected using either BIC or NN. The optimizaion problem is simply selecting the number of splines in a grid going from 4 to 10 PCs that generated the lowest BIC or NN.

Tables [-@tbl-vd-bic-nn] and [-@tbl-vd-pc-bic] display the rejection frequencies for the different variance estimators for the optimal number of PCs.
