## SCPC limitations

Open questions to address in Spatial Correlation Principal Component (SCPC) [@Muller2022JBES; @Muller2022ECTA]:

1. What's the "worst case" covariance matrix? How does that work? A: See section on that @sec-worstcov
2. Can SCPC accommodate a vector of variables? A: Not currently. It only works for scalars. The authors discuss that the main challenge for the multivariate version of the SCPC is specifying the worst-case benchmark model and numerically determining the critical value. In the case of the C-SCPC, the challenge is to specify an appropriate multivariate extension of the heteroscedastic model foe $e_l$ given $e_l=x^s_la_l$.
3. Does the method work if there exists measurement error in the locations?
