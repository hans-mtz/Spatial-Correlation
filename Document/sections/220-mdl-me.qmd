## Measurement error{#sec-me}

In this exercise, measurement error in locations is introduced. Measurement error is modeled as disturbance of the locations, where the disturbances are centered at zero and are not greater than a pre-specified percentage of the radius of a circle. The radii of the disturbances are 1, 2, and 3 percent the length of the unit circle.

Likewise, this exercise evaluates how the rejection frequencies of the different inference methods change when the average pairwise correlation $\bar\rho$ of the true DGP varies. Of particular interest is the response of the MW's method, as it relies on a pre-specified maximum value $\bar\rho_{max}$ that should be provided by the practitioner beforehand; the default value is 0.03.

![ME in locations, 30%]("../Simulations/Products/hist_dist_me_30p.png"){#fig-loc-me fig-scap="Histogram of distances using true and mismeasured locations when ME is 30 percent."}

In short, the rejection frequencies and the CI length increase if the DGP's $\bar\rho$ is greater than the default MW's method, and vice versa, they decrease if smaller. The rejection frequencies of the constant are significantly affected by the misspecification of $\bar\rho_{max}$, while the slope's rejection frequencies are only modestly affected. This result aligns with what @Muller2022JBES discuss in their paper (p.12). On the other hand, ME increases the rejection frequencies, but moderately. When ME is 3%, there is almost a 1 percent increase in the constant, but almost no increase in the slope for both SCPC and C-SCPC.

Tables [-@tbl-no-me-r-10p and -@tbl-no-me-r-1p] display the results when there is no measurement error and the true $\bar\rho$ is above (0.10) MW's method default value (0.03) or below (0.01). Tables [-@tbl-me-3p-r-10p and -@tbl-me-3p-r-1p] show the same exercise but when the locations are mismeasured and the radius of the disturbances are 3% the length of the unit circle.

In @tbl-no-me-r-10p, when there is no ME and the $\bar\rho$ is significantly greater (0.10) than the $\bar\rho_{max}$ provided (0), the rejection frequencies of the C-SCPC and SCPC for the constant increase to 12 and 14 percent. For the slope SCPC is 6 and C-SCPC 4 percent; not much difference. This is consistent with what @Muller2022JBES report in their paper. They argue that the C-SCPC rejection frequency depends on the spatial correlation of $u=x'e$, which might be substantially lower than the spatial correlation of $e$; but when $x=1$, $u=e$, hence the higher rejection frequencies of the constant. Moreover, the length of the Confidence Interval increases from 0.5, when $\bar\rho$ is not misspecified, to 0.7, in the case of the slope, and from 0.8 to 1.0 for the constant. 

Unsurprisingly, when the $\bar\rho$ is lower (0.01) than the $\bar\rho_{max}$ (0.03), the rejection frequencies and the CI lengths decrease significantly. In @tbl-no-me-r-1p, the slope rejection frequencies of the SCPC and C-SCPC decrease from 0.4 of the no misspecification case to 3.7 and 3 percent. The slope C.I. lengths of both decrease from 0.5 to 0.4. The constant rejection frequencies of SCPC go down from 5 to 3 and of C-SCPC from 4 to 3 percent.

When the radius of the disturbances is 3 percent, the rejection frequencies of the SCPC and C-SCPC increase significantly for the constant but modestly for the slope [@tbl-me-3p-r-10p; @tbl-me-3p-r-1p]. Whereas the CI lengths of both SCPC and C-SCPC almost remain unchanged.

### Discussion {#sec-me-diss}

These results are in line with what @Muller2022ECTA discuss. When the locations are uniformly distributed, ME will not greatly affect the rejection frequencies of SCPC. However, they can lead to substantial size distortions when the locations are highly concentrated in a few spots. That is, there are large areas where there are no observations and most observations are clustered around a few random locations, for example, when the locations are more likely to be sampled from areas of higher economic activity measured by light intensity as seen from space. This makes sense if we consider the shape of the distribution of locations and ME. When the distribution of locations is uniform, the shape of the distribution would look flat. Adding uniformly distributed ME would not change the shape. However, locations that are highly concentrated in a few spots would have a highly skewed distribution shape. Adding uniformly distributed ME would flatten the shape of the distribution.

When the locations and the ME both are uniformly distributed and there is no average pairwise correlation misspecification, $\bar\rho$ and $\bar\rho_{max}$ will be the same. The only difference between the true and the guessed average pairwise correlation will be the value of the covariance function constant, $c_{\bar\rho}$. In our setting, the DGP exactly matches the one assumed in the SCPC, in particular, the covariance function, $cov(e_l,e_{l'})=\exp(-c||s_l-s_{l'}||)$. Then, the average pairwise correlation is $\bar{\rho}\equiv[n(n-1)]^{-1}\sum_{l,l'\not=l}\exp(-c_{\bar{\rho}}||s_l-s_{l'}||)$. When there is measurement error $s_l=s_l^*+\upsilon_l$, SCPC will find the $c_{\bar\rho^{ME}}$ that matches $\bar{\rho}_{max}=[n(n-1)]^{-1}\sum_{l,l'\not=l}\exp(-c_{\bar{\rho}^{ME}}||s_l^*-s^*_{l'}+\upsilon_l-\upsilon_{l'}||)$. Both values of $c_{\bar\rho^{ME}}$ and $c_{\bar\rho}$ are going to be very close. For example, in a random draw, when ME is 3 percent, $\bar\rho=0.034$ and $\bar\rho_{max}$, the $c_{\bar\rho}=13.1850$ and $c_{\bar\rho^{ME}}=13.1215$.
