## Updates {-}

- Uniformly distributed locations: @tbl-kernel updated. Damian's BIC and Kernel distance. SCPC and C-SCPC rejection frequencies. Splines of high order. Average number of dropped splines.
- Evenly distributed locations: @tbl-grid-all updated. Damian's BIC and Kernel distance.

## To-Do {-}

- Evenly distributed locations: SCPC adjusting $\bar\rho$ to avoid crashing.
- Power curves for SCPC method
- Cluster version of Kernel estimator
- Measurement error in the locations
    a.	Get rejection freq.
    b.	Plot distances (true vs. mismeasured)
