# Updates {-}

- @sec-me contains the tables of the rejection frequencies when the locations are two-dimensional, locations are mismeasured, and the $\bar\rho_{max}$ is misspecified. In short, the rejection frequencies and the CI length increase if the DGP's $\bar\rho$ is greater than the default MW's method, and vice versa, they decrease if smaller. The rejection frequencies of the constant are significantly affected by the misspecification of $\bar\rho_{max}$, while the slope not so much. This result aligns with what @Muller2022JBES discuss in their paper (p.12).
- ME seems to increase the rejection frequencies, but moderately. When ME is 3%, there is almost a 1 percent increase in the constant, but almost not increase in the slope for both SCPC and C-SCPC.

## To-Do {-}

- Adjust Kernel cutoff length when there is ME
- Cluster version of Kernel estimator.


## Note {-}

The average C.V. of the SCPC is 2.2856 for the constant and the slope. The average C.V. of the C-SCPC is 2.3656 for the constant and 2.4971 for the slope.

# Multidimensional locations {#sec-multi} 

In this set of simulations, the locations are two-dimensional. The locations are independent and follow a uniform distribution. The DGP is the same as described in @sec-dgp.
