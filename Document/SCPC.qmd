- @tbl-grid evenly-spaced locations with order one and two B-Splines, for 4, 12, 36, 64, 88, 102, and 124 splines.

- Average pairwise correlation by groups of different cut-off distances displayed in @tbl-rho-bar-ar1.

- Double bar histogram of the evenly-spaced and uniformly distributed distances for 250 and 2500 simulated observations [@fig-hist-loc; and -@fig-hist-loc-x10].

- @tbl-kernel using 2500 obs. @tbl-ar1-mean for the residuals' AR(1) model.
