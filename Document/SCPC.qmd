## Updates {-}

- @tbl-pc, [-@tbl-pc-ts], [-@tbl-gamma], [-@tbl-gamma-ts], [-@tbl-bic], and [-@tbl-bic-ts] now show the average confidence interval length instead of the average s.e.
- Time series @tbl-pc-ts, [-@tbl-gamma-ts], and [-@tbl-bic-ts] now show the results for the SCPC and C-SCPC estimators.
- The average C.V. of the SCPC is 2.2856 for the constant and the slope. The average C.V. of the C-SCPC is 2.3656 for the constant and 2.4971 for the slope.

## To-Do {-}

- Move to two-dimension spatial locations. Use Nearest Neighbor instead of $\gamma$. When using evenly spaced locations, jitter locations. If $s\sim U(0,1)$ jitter by $\iota\sim U(-0.001,0.001)$.
- Power curves for the SCPC and C-SCPC methods.
- Cluster version of Kernel estimator.
- Measurement error in the locations.
    a.	Get rejection freq.
    b.	Plot distances (true vs. mismeasured).
