## Updates {-}

- @sec-multi contains the tables of the rejection frequencies when the locations are two-dimensional for the case of the spatial DGP.


## To-Do {-}

- Two-dimension spatial locations with evenly spaced locations. Jitter locations. If $s\sim U(0,1)$ jitter by $\iota\sim U(-0.001,0.001)$.
- Power curves for the SCPC and C-SCPC methods.
- Cluster version of Kernel estimator.
- Measurement error in the locations.
    a.	Get rejection freq.
    b.	Plot distances (true vs. mismeasured).

## Note {-}

The average C.V. of the SCPC is 2.2856 for the constant and the slope. The average C.V. of the C-SCPC is 2.3656 for the constant and 2.4971 for the slope.
