# Updates {-}

- Tim's Stat added
- 5\% CI length table added

## Note {-}

The average C.V. of the SCPC is 2.2856 for the constant and the slope. The average C.V. of the C-SCPC is 2.3656 for the constant and 2.4971 for the slope.

# Multidimensional locations {#sec-multi} 

In this set of simulations, the locations are two-dimensional. The locations are independent and follow a uniform distribution. The DGP is the same as described in @sec-dgp.
